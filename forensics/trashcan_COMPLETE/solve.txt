Challenge: Trashcan
Category: Forensics
Author: John Hammond

Description:
Have you ever done forensics on the Recycle Bin? It's... a bit of a mess. Looks like the threat actor pulled some tricks to hide data here though.

The metadata might not be what it should be. Can you find a flag?

Solve:

1. Download and extract the challenge files

2. They are all prefixed $I which could correspond to $R files I learned after reading this articile on Recycle Bin Forensics

3. I used "$I File Parser" from FlashBackData to reconstruct the data

4. The filsizes looked like a familiar decimal pattern, throwing a couple values into CyberChef confirmed that

5. I had a a Python script generated to extract the values, and construct a flag from my results.csv
