Challenge: Tabby's Date
Category: Forensics
Author: John Hammond

Description:

Ohhhh, Tab, Tab, Tab.... what has she done.

My friend Tabby just got a new laptop and she's been using it to take notes. She says she puts her whole life on there!

She was so excited to finally have a date with a boy she liked, but she completely forgot the details of where and when. She told me she remembers writing it in a note... but she doesn't think she saved it!!

She shared with us an export of her laptop files.

tabbys_date.zip

39.8 kB

NOTE
The password to the ZIP archive is "tabbys_date".

Can you help us find the details of Tab's date?

1. I used FlareVM for this challenge. Given the clues in the description, this is a recovery of a Notepad.exe tab.
2. In 7zip, you can see all the files/folders are 0 in size, keep following the largest size to the following folder

	2a. C:\Users\Tabby\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\TabState\

3. Start with the largest file and open with Notepad++, and the flag is presented in the text. [tabbys-date-1.png]
