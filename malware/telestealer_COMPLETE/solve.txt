Solve:

** This was solved before the challenge was updated. **


1. Download and extract the challenge files

2. I extracted the base64 from [telestealer] and saved as [stage2.ps1]

3. I changed the last few lines of [stage2.ps1] to the following and saved as [stage3.ps1]. The changes removed the execution and saved the [x.exe] binary in the local folder.

$aes    = [System.Security.Cryptography.Aes]::Create()
$aes.Key = $key
$aes.IV  = $iv
$dec    = $aes.CreateDecryptor()
$plain  = $dec.TransformFinalBlock($cipher, 0, $cipher.Length)
$out    = 'x.exe'
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($out, $plain)
#Start-Process -FilePath $out

4. Once the [x.exe] binary was built I ran it through FLOSS and saved the output as [x-strings.txt]

5. Given the challenge context, I was able to deduce that this was a Telegram Bot Token and possible profile ID.

6. Dumping the bot data with [telegram-bot-dumper] from: [https://github.com/soxoj/telegram-bot-dumper] we can see our flag.
