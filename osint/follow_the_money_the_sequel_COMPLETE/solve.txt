Description:

WARNING

The initial Follow the Money challenge should be completed first before this challenge.

Hey Support Team,

Thanks for your help the other day! After seeing the way you handled yourself and gathered these details, I wanted to see if I could get a bit more help from you. I know you found their username the other day. See what you can do with that. I need you to find the town that this hacker lives in. I don't think the IR firm is doing enough. I want to have every piece of information we can find. Maybe we can pay a visit. Let me know what you find. Thanks!

IMPORTANT

This challenge DOES NOT require you to contact any businesses. This can be fully solved with publicly available information. Being that this is OSINT and public-facing, please DO NOT do anything to disrupt other CTF players or others that are not involved with the CTF.

IMPORTANT

This challenge uses a non-standard flag format.

Flag #1: What town does our hacker friend live in?
Flag #2: Can you find the nearby flag?
